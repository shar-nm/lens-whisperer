# Aperture Adventurers

Aperture Adventurers is a site intended at aspiring and up-coming photographers. Photographers can share their work for feedback and reviews from their peers, sharing tips tricks and techniques on how to achieve the best photo. They can be inspiration to each other and help elevate their photography skills and unleash creative potential. As this is a learning platform fully fledged photographers are welcome to join and share their expertise. Admin will provide a newsletter with content ranging from insightful tutorials and gear reviews to sharing information on photography events and exhibition shows around the country.

Here's my deployed site :

## UX 

For this Photography blog site. The photographer is menat to feel the ownership of the site. There is an image whith photography reference on each page, with the landing page consisting of 3 photographers. A man and a young woman to show inclusivity of all genders and age groups. The login and signup forms have a retro camera inbedded to keep with the recurring theme. 

 The site carrys a clean theme and the colors as nuetral as possible. One of the platform's main objectives is to share images. Images will have all different colors amnd composition therefore the need  to reduce the noise and let the images be the focal point. The background body has been kept white with a dark footer to frame the content, the crispy green tone of the navbar is to provide freshness and subtle to give the content precidence.

## Database Design 

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/shar-nm/lens-whisperer/projects) 

GitHub Projects is the Agile tool used for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/shar-nm/lens-whisperer/issues) 

This as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration
